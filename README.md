# [Resizehelper](http://www.resizehelper.com/)

**Disclaimer:**
Resizehelper is currently in alpha and I am acively developing it. This means that everything is subject to change and the project should be seen as a prototype for an idea that is constantly evolving. I am still working on the storage of data; which can be cleared without any notice. You have been warned.

## About the project
The project was born out of a problem I have encountered in my previous work that I set out to solve while learning more about knockout.js and everything that is involved with publishing a site.

While this is very much a learning experience I might be hesitant to accept pull requests as I would like to code as much as possible by myself.
[//]: # (if you have any suggestions or feedback you can always create a issue here on github. note: I need to research this more. -- is this comment a easteregg? here, have a shrug ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

Also, I am developing this project on my free time inbetween looking for a job, so updates may be very sporradic.

## What is resizehelper?
Resizehelper is meant to help you decide at which sizes you should resize an image to on your site to provide better loading times across different devices (especially mobile devices).

It should also help you with the srcset syntax for responsive images with its generated output.

[You can read more about the srcset syntax here.](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/)

#### What is resizehelper NOT?
Resizehelper will not resize or optimze your image (it might in the future, but that is not the goal at this moment), it will simply let you test different resizes of your image and provide generated suggestions with your parameters.

Resizehelper only works with the srcset syntax at this moment for switching between different resolutions of the same image, if you need to switch between images you should use the picture tag.
